      <h1>About Our Microfossil Identification Project</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to our microfossil identification website! Our goal is to create
        a platform where individuals can view images of matrix samples and help
        determine whether or not they contain microfossils. This initiative is
        not only a crucial step towards training a machine learning model but
        also offers various other benefits.
      </p>

      <h2>Purpose and Uses</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Machine Learning:</strong> By collecting data on the presence of
        microfossils, we aim to develop a robust machine learning model capable
        of identifying microfossils in matrix samples. Your contributions are
        vital in making this model accurate and reliable.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Educational Resource:</strong> This platform serves as a
        learning tool for students and enthusiasts interested in paleontology
        and microfossils. Users can enhance their skills in recognizing
        different types of microfossils through hands-on experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Citizen Engagement:</strong> We encourage citizen scientists to
        participate in our project. It's an excellent opportunity for
        individuals to engage with science and contribute to real research from
        the comfort of their homes.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Just for Fun:</strong> For those who enjoy puzzles and pattern
        recognition, identifying microfossils can be a fun and rewarding
        activity. Discover the fascinating world of microfossils and enjoy the
        satisfaction of contributing to scientific knowledge.
      </p>
